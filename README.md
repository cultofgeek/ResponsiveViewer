ResponsiveViewer
================

A tool for viewing a webpage's responsive layouts. This project is based on [Switcheroo](https://github.com/OriginalEXE/Switcheroo).

I would have forked that project, but the two purposes are somewhat different. This slimmed down version is really intended to allow designers/developers to preview their responsive design layouts and to easily share the responsive layout with outside stakeholders such as clients. The original Switcheroo was more for showcasing Wordpress products.

The project provides 4 different view switches: desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile.

I also added a querystring option for url, so that the page will jump to the appropriate page immediately.
